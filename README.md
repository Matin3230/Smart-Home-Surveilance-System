# Smart-Home-Surveilance-System-Using-AI

  This is a real-time face recognition system that reads a video from a camera connected to the computer running the software, detects any face present in front of the camera, and then checks if this face is present in a set of face images in a database using face recognition technique. The software is divided into two parts: face detection and face recognition. If unknown person was detected then alert will send to authorized user and Alarm will ring.
