# Smart-Home-Surveilance-System-Using-AI


  Many face recognition software have been implemented during the past decade. 
Each software uses different methods and different algorithm than other software.
Some facial recognition software extracts the face features from the input image
to identify the face. Other algorithms normalize a set of face images and then 
compress the face data, the saves the data in one image that can be used for facial
recognition. The input image is compared with the face data.
  The proposed solution is a real-time face recognition system that reads a video
from a camera connected to the computer running the software, detects any face
present in front of the camera, and then checks if this face is present in a 
set of face images in a database using face recognition technique. The software
is divided into two parts: face detection and face recognition. If unknown person
was detected then alert will send to authorized user and Alarm will ring.
