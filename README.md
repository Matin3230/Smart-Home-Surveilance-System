# Smart-Home-Surveilance-System-Using-AI


**Abstract**

  This is a real-time face recognition system that reads a video from a camera connected to the computer running the software, detects any face present in front of the camera, and then checks if this face is present in a set of face images in a database using face recognition technique. The software is divided into two parts: face detection and face recognition. If unknown person was detected then alert will send to authorized user and Alarm will ring.

**About Application :**

a. Safety and security are significant challenges facing modern society.

b. These issues aim to protect people's lives and valuable assets from illegal handling.

c. Safety and security extend to personal social security, protecting individuals' personal information, valuables, and daily activities.

d. This system can detect intruders in restricted or high-security areas and minimize human error.

e. The system uses algorithms and machine learning to identify and match facial patterns with a database of known individuals.

f. The system can provide real-time alerts to security personnel, enabling them to take appropriate action.
