# Smart-Home-Surveilance-System-Using-AI

Proposed System

Many face recognition software have been implemented during the past decade. 
Each software uses different methods and different algorithm than other software.
Some facial recognition software extracts the face features from the input image
to identify the face. Other algorithms normalize a set of face images and then 
compress the face data, the saves the data in one image that can be used for facial
recognition. The input image is compared with the face data.
